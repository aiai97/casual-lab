I want to be as cute and skilled at programming as the legendary bald and gray-haired geeks I admire. I hope that even in my fifties, sixties, or seventies, I’ll still be coding with the same passion. One day, at tech conferences, I want to meet these masters, get their autographs, touch their heads—bald or not—and soak up some of their luck and wisdom.

I want to set my goals in my twenties so that by the time I’m older, I can be as smart as they are—writing excellent code, creating meaningful products, or even defining standards. I believe a life like this is truly meaningful: like a faint star at the beginning, gradually growing into a sky full of brilliance and awe.

Actually, I’ve always thought that being very direct in speech is a flaw, but I feel that if I were as smart as they are, I would naturally speak more directly too.
